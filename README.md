## Features

GenVarLoader provides a fast, memory efficient data structure for training sequence models on genetic variation. For example, this can be used to train a DNA language model on human genetic variation (e.g. [Dalla-Torre et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.11.523679)) or train sequence to function models with genetic variation (e.g. [Celaj et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.20.558508v1), [Drusinsky et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.27.605449v1), [He et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.15.618510v1), and [Rastogi et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.23.614632v1)).

- Avoid writing any sequences to disk (can save >2,000x storage vs. writing personalized genomes with bcftools consensus)
- Generate haplotypes up to 1,000 times faster than reading a FASTA file
- Generate tracks up to 450 times faster than reading a BigWig
- **Supports indels** and re-aligns tracks to haplotypes that have them
- Extensible to new file formats: drop a feature request! Currently supports VCF, PGEN, and BigWig

Documentation is available [here](https://genvarloader.readthedocs.io/). See our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.15.633240) for benchmarking and implementation details.

## Installation

```bash
pip install genvarloader
```

A PyTorch dependency is **not** included since it may require [special instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Contributing

1. Clone the repo.
2. Assuming you have [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), install pre-commit hooks `pixi run -e dev pre-commit`
3. Activate and use the appropriate Pixi environment for your needs. A decent catch-all is `dev` but you might need a different environment if using a GPU.

All the tests are designed to use pytest (sans Rust extension code) and live under `tests/`. These tests ensure the code works as intended so they must all pass before any features are merged into `main` and subsequently released. These tests will automatically run on every PR and failing tests will block merging.

> Do not edit the version number in `pyproject.toml`. This is handled automatically by GitHub Actions.
