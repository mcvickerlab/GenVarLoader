"""SVAR2 mixed variants + tracks parity (issue #375, Track A).

The written oracle is `HapsTracks._call_svar2` (`_reconstruct.py:309`), which
splits the interval->realign step into `intervals_to_tracks` +
`shift_and_realign_tracks_from_svar2_readbound` because SVAR2 has no fused
kernel. This suite pins the streaming SVAR2 mixed drive against
`Dataset[r, s]` cell by cell, BOTH halves of the `(haps, tracks)` pair
(issue #380).
